  <h1>Our Story</h1>

  <p>Tristan and Heather first met in January 2014.  After moving across town, Tristan needed a new spot to watch hockey; lucky for them both, he chose The Chimes East. Despite a chance meeting, by summertime the two of them had become friends.  Over the summer, as they grew closer, a spark ignited between them.  Although Heather didn’t realize it at the time, most of their friends did.  After joining Tristan’s fantasy hockey league that fall, their relationship headed in a new direction.</p>
  <p>In March of 2015, Tristan and Heather finally decided to go a date, then another date a few weeks later.  Tristan had definitely fallen for Heather, but due to fear of losing Tristan as a friend, Heather was reluctant to pull the trigger.  Despite the reluctance, the two of them remained close friends and spent a lot of their time together.  Luckily, Tristan ignored his friends when they told him to give up on Heather, because his persistence paid off.  Heather eventually realized, who better to date than her best friend.  On July 31, they officially became a couple. </p>
  <p>During the fall of 2015, Tristan and Heather truly started falling in love.  They met and became close with each other’s families and friends and also shared their love of traveling by taking several trips together.  Tristan shared in Heather’s love of soccer and she shared in his love for hockey.  First and foremost, they had solidified themselves as best friends, which was the foundation they needed in deciding to get married.  </p>
  <p>On May 14th, 2016, during a vacation in St. Martin, Tristan popped the question.  The two of them were sitting on the porch of their vacation house, talking and listening to music.  They were both in bathing suits, tired from traveling, but when Queen’s “You’re My Best Friend” started playing, Tristan found it the perfect moment to propose.  He got down on one knee and asked Heather to be his wife.  After several minutes of hugs, kisses, and crying, Heather eventually said YES!!  </p>
  <p>Now, only a few months from the BIG DAY, the two of them are excited to be planning their small, yet, intimate wedding and are happy to be including their family and closest friends.  They are extremely excited for their upcoming nuptials and can’t wait to begin their lives together as husband and wife!</p>
