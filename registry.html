  <h1>Registry</h1>

  <p>During recent flooding in Louisiana, many of our family and friends lost homes, vehicles, and property.  We would like any gifts that would have been given to us as a wedding present, be given in the form of money, which we will donate to our family and friends who were affected.  Due to the fees that most crowd funding websites require, we ask that you give cash or write us a check so that 100% of the money we receive can be put to good use.</p>
  <p>If you insist on giving us a gift as well, you can visit our honeymoon registry by clicking the link below.</p>
  <p>We are so happy that you all are being a part of our special day and can not wait to see you at the wedding!</p>
  <p>Love,<br>
     Tristan and Heather</p>
