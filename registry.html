  <h1>Registry</h1>

  <p>During recent flooding in Louisiana, many of our family and friends lost homes, vehicles, and property.  We would like any gifts that would have been given to us as a wedding present, be given in the form of money.  We will donate these funds to our family and friends who were affected.  Due to the fees that most crowd funding website require, we ask that you give cash or write us a chec so that 100% of the money we receive can be put to good use.</p>
