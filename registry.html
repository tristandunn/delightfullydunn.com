  <h1>Registry</h1>

  <p>During the recent flooding in Louisiana, many of our family and friends lost homes, vehicles, and property.  We would like any gifts, which would have been given to us as a wedding present, be given to us in the form of money.  We will donate these fund towards our family and friends who need it most.  Due to the fee's that most crowd funding website require, we ask that you give cash or write us a check, so that 100% of the money we receive can be put to good use.</p>
